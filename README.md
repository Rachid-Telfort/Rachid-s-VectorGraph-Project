Rachidâ€™s VectorGraph Project README

About
	This project was a personal project that I did in order to try something different than what I have been doing so far as well as an attempt to implement a simple graphics program since I am interested in the gaming industry. In addition, I also undertook this -project to improve my skills in C++. Unlike my other projects so far, this project mainly consists of a few examples that will allow one to see the various ways one could potentially use the program.
  
Executable File Use
	The executable file mainly shows some examples of what one can do with the program. After the examples display a menu prompt will ask the user if they would like to run through the examples again or quit the program. To go through the examples again, type anything and press enter. To quit the program type NO and press enter. This was done to stop the executable from quickly disappearing after running so one can see through the examples.
  
Source Code Use
	The source code associated with this project is free for anyone to use and hopefully/possibly extend. If one has found any bugs or has any suggestions relating to the source code, please comment on the project page or e-mail me at rachidtelfort@gmail.com.
  
Final Notes
	In addition to the examples I have posted screenshots of the examples for easy viewing if one cannot view the examples from the executable file. Finally, I hope that my fellow coders will find the source code helpful as well as gain valuable insight from it. If you have read this, thank you for looking at my GitHub page it is much appreciated.
